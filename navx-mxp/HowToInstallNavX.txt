Instructions for the installation of required libraries to compile and use the NavX gyroscope.
Pulled from the following official navX installation instructions located at http://www.pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/c/

First you must install the library onto your {HOME} directory using the navX installer
Go to http://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/navx-mxp/navx-mxp.zip to download the required files
Unzip the files anywhere, and run setup.exe

This will install the library in addition to various UI applications to view sensor data on the MXP

Open eclipse and your desired 2016 project
Right click 2016 project, and click properties

Under C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> Cross G++ Compiler -> Includes
Click the green plus button to add another include path, set "${HOME}\navx-mxp\cpp\include" as the directory
Make sure there is only one set of quotes surrounding the path when copying

Now move onto linking the library in Cross G++ Linker -> Libraries
Under Libraries, click the green plus and add navx_frc_cpp as the library name
Now click the newly added library and move it above your wpilib library so that it links beforehand
Now under library search path, add the following directory "${HOME}/navx-mxp/cpp/lib"
